# AIM

To Simulate the Spread Spectrum Modulation Techniques using python programming.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

Python colab

# ALGORITHMS

1. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
Transmitter Side:

Data Generation: Create the original data sequence intended for transmission.

Spreading Code Generation: Produce a pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence.

Modulation: Combine the data sequence with the PN sequence using techniques like Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK).

Transmission: Send the modulated signal over the communication channel.

Receiver Side:

Reception: Capture the transmitted signal.

Despreading: Multiply the received signal with a synchronized PN sequence identical to the transmitter's.

Demodulation: Retrieve the original data sequence from the despread signal.

2. Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
Transmitter Side:

Data Generation: Create the original data sequence.

Frequency Hopping Pattern: Generate a sequence that determines the order of frequency changes.

Modulation: Modulate the data onto a carrier frequency that changes according to the hopping pattern.

Transmission: Send the frequency-hopped signal over the channel.

Receiver Side:

Synchronization: Align with the transmitter's frequency hopping pattern.

Reception: Capture the frequency-hopped signal.

Demodulation: Extract the original data sequence by demodulating the signal at each hopped frequency.
